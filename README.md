**Interactive Visuals:** Dynamic charts and graphs provide clear insights into sales trends across various time ranges and product categories.
**User-Friendly Interface:** Navigate through daily, weekly, and time-specific sales data with easy-to-use filters.
**Product & Time Analysis:** Compare sales across different products and identify optimal selling times (AM/PM, weekdays).

## ‚ú® Features & Benefits

**1. Dynamic Time Range Analysis (AM/PM)**
Split your sales data into AM and PM ranges, allowing precise identification of peak sales periods.
Discover which time of day drives the most revenue and optimize marketing and operations accordingly.

**2. Day-wise & Weekly Sales Insights**
A detailed weekdays sales analysis provides clear visual representation of sales trends from Sunday to Saturday.
Easily spot the highest and lowest performing days of the week, helping to tailor promotional strategies.

**3. Day & Time Breakdown**
The Weekdays Sales Analysis (displayed as a bar chart) gives a time-specific breakdown for each day, showing which days of the week see the most sales and during which time slots (AM/PM).
This breakdown is essential for businesses that want to:
Plan inventory and staffing based on daily and weekly trends.
Schedule promotions to align with peak selling times on different days

**4. Product Performance Dashboard**
Analyze individual product performance across different time periods.
View the top-performing products and identify underperformers at a glance with the intuitive products analysis chart.

Automatically highlight the Top Selling Day and Least Selling Day with transaction and revenue details.
This information helps businesses plan around seasonal demand or adjust strategy for low-performing periods.

 **6. Ideal Selling Times**
The dashboard includes a suggestion box that pinpoints the ideal selling times, recommending the most profitable hours of the day. For example, in your dashboard, the ideal selling times are highlighted as 10 AM, 11 AM, and 7 AM.
By understanding when the majority of sales occur, businesses can:
Allocate marketing spend during these peak hours.
Ensure staff coverage is sufficient to handle the increased volume during these times.
Tailor promotions and discounts to drive even higher sales during these windows.

**7. Macro-Driven Automation**
Reduce manual data entry with built-in macros that automatically fetch, clean, and process sales data.
The dashboard updates in real-time as new data is recorded, ensuring you‚Äôre always working with the latest insights.

Least Performance Day: Identify the day with the lowest sales via Mastercard to focus on driving better engagement on those specific days.
Usage Share: The dashboard visualizes the share of Mastercard transactions against other cards, helping businesses negotiate better rates with Mastercard providers based on their customer base.

Transaction Volume: Visa, typically the most popular payment method, has a dedicated section showing the total number of Visa transactions and their contribution to total sales.
